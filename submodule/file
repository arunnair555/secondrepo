Before you can commit and push, you need to init a working repository tree for a submodule. I am using tortoise and do following things:

First check if there exist .git file (not a directory)

if there is such file it contains path to supermodule git directory
delete this file
do git init
do git add remote path the one used for submodule
follow instructions below
If there was .git file, there surly was .git directory which tracks local tree. You still need to a branch (you can create one) or switch to master (which sometimes does not work). Best to do is - git fetch - git pull. Do not omit fetch.

Now your commits and pulls will be synchronized with your origin/master
